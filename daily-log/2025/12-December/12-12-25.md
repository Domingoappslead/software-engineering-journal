## Choose Clear, Intent-Revealing Names
## What I Learned Today
1. Exact Definition

    Names should clearly communicate what something is and why it exists.
    A reader should understand a variable, method, class, or parameter name without needing comments or guessing.

2. Simpler Explanation

    Use names that describe the purpose, not the mechanics.
    A good name makes code self-explanatory.

3. Real-World Analogy

    If a drawer is labeled only “Stuff,” no one knows what’s inside.
    If it says “Kitchen Utensils,” anyone can find what they need without opening it.

## Key Takeaways / Important Concepts
Clear names reduce cognitive load for everyone who touches the system—including future you.

Why This Matters (Reasoning You Should Internalize)
1. Code becomes easier to read and easier to teach to new teammates.

2. Your future self immediately understands your intention.

3. Reduces the need for comments.

4. Prevents misunderstandings that lead to bugs.

5. Stronger mental model for Clean Architecture layers.

Clear names = fewer mistakes + higher maintainability.

## Practical .NET Examples
#### 1. Variable Naming

**Poor**
```csharp
var p = Get(id);
```
The name gives no context. Is it a product? Person? Price?

**Clean**
```csharp
var product = await GetProductAsync(id);
```
The name communicates intent:

- It’s a product.

- It’s retrieved.

- It's asynchronous.

#### 2. Method Naming

**Poor**

```csharp
public async Task Handle(Product p)
```

What does “Handle” mean? Update? Create? Validate?

**Clean**

```csharp
public async Task UpdateProductAsync(Product product)
```

Clear verb + object + async suffix.

#### 3. Parameter Naming

**Poor**

```csharp
public Product Map(ProductDto d)
```

What is d? A date? A discount?

**Clean**
```csharp
public Product MapProduct(ProductDto productDto)
```

#### 4. Class Naming

**Poor**

```csharp
public class Utils { }
```

“Utils/Helpers/Common” is always a red flag—they contain unrelated behaviors.

**Clean**

Split by responsibility:

```csharp
public class PriceCalculator { }
public class ProductValidator { }
public class StockAdjustmentService { }
```

A class name tells you what problem it solves.

#### Additional .NET Naming Standards You Should Internalize
##### Use Async suffix for asynchronous methods

```csharp
GetProductAsync()
UpdateInventoryAsync()
```

Use verbs for methods, nouns for classes
- Methods: `CalculateTotal()`, `Validate()`, `CreateOrder()`
- Classes: `ProductService`, `InventoryRepository`

Do not abbreviate unless industry-standard
- Bad: `prod`, `invRepo`, `ctx`
- Good: `product`, `inventoryRepository`, `dbContext`

Avoid Mental Mapping

Do not make the reader translate alias → meaning.
