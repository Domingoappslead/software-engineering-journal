# Software Engineering Journal

 structured, long-term learning journal documenting my journey to becoming an effective software engineer. This repository captures all of my learning in text format: notes, explanations, daily reflections, conceptual breakdowns, and references.

 This journal is designed to be:
- A personal knowledge base  
- A reference I can quickly revisit  
- A record of my skill growth  
- A well-organized index of everything I study  

All content is written in Markdown and categorized for long-term scalability.

## Contribution Rules (Personal)

This repository is for my personal learning. Guidelines:
- Keep notes focused and concise.  
- One concept per file.  
- Logs should be short; notes should be detailed.  
- Use dates in all daily logs.  
- Update the main README when adding new top-level sections.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a long-term knowledge base as I grow from a junior software engineer into a strong .NET developer with expertise in C#, .NET 8, API design, Blazor, and software engineering fundamentals.
