# Software Engineering Journal

A comprehensive, long-term learning repository documenting my journey toward becoming a proficient software engineer specializing in C#, .NET, and modern web development. This journal serves as a structured knowledge base, capturing technical concepts, daily progress, and practical insights in a scalable, reference-friendly format.

## Overview

This repository is designed to be:
- **A Personal Knowledge Base** — Centralized documentation of everything I learn
- **A Quick Reference Guide** — Structured for efficient lookup and review
- **A Growth Record** — Chronicles my evolution from foundational concepts to advanced practices
- **A Scalable System** — Organized for long-term expansion across multiple domains

All content is written in Markdown and follows consistent formatting standards for maintainability.

## Documentation Standards

To maintain quality and consistency across all entries:

### Daily Logs
- Use the provided template (`daily-log/template.md`)
- Include date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Focus on learning outcomes, not just activities

### Technical Notes
- One concept per file
- Follow the notes template (`notes/notes-template.md`)
